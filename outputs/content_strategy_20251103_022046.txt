**Comprehensive Content Strategy for Eterna (formerly TechCorp)**

**Executive Summary:**

This content strategy is designed for Eterna, a Series A FinTech startup specializing in a unified trading platform for retail traders and high-frequency trading (HFT) firms, with a core focus on perpetual options. The strategy aims to achieve brand awareness, drive lead generation, and foster strong customer engagement by leveraging Eterna's unique value proposition of institutional-grade performance with retail accessibility.

**Important Clarification on Target Audience:**
The initial request specified "Small to Medium Businesses." However, the provided Eterna documentation clearly defines the target audience as **Retail Traders** and **High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Firms**. This strategy is built upon Eterna's defined target segments, as the detailed information provided is specific to these two distinct audiences and their needs within the financial trading space. Should "TechCorp" truly represent a broader SMB audience outside of trading, this strategy would require adaptation, but for Eterna, this targeted approach is optimal.
