LLM Service

Provides an interface to interact with the Llama-3 8B NIM (NVIDIA Inference Microservice) API.
Handles all LLM-related operations including:
- Text generation and completion
- Chat-based interactions
- Model configuration and parameters
- Response formatting and parsing
- Error handling and retries

This service acts as a wrapper around the NIM API, providing a clean interface
for other components to access LLM capabilities.
